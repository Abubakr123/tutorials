Fourier Transforms
==================

Some introductory Fourier Transforms ipython notebooks. Most of these notebooks were developed for the 2015 Radio Interferometry Workshop at NWU.

The notebooks demonstrate:

1. Construction of a sine function out of sine components
2. Exercise: Construction of a triangle wave function
3. An explicit DFT
4. Basic Fourier transform pairs
