Radiation Fundamentals
==================

Some introductory Radiation Fundamentals ipython notebooks. These notebooks were developed for the [NASSP](http://www.star.ac.za) honours course in Radio Astronomy.
(Two of the notebooks include nbformat 2 versions, from IPython version 0.12, due to the then computer lab requirement of the NASSP course.)

The notebooks demonstrate:

1. Radiation & Flux
2. Radiative Transfer
3. Blackbody Radiation
4. Dipole Radiation
