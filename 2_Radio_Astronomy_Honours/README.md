Radio Astronomy honours/graduate course
=======================================

This set of IPython notebook based tutorials and lecture notes follows the 
NRAO [Essential Radio Astronomy](http://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/ERA.shtml) course.
They were developed to the [NASSP](http://www.star.ac.za) honours course in Radio Astronomy.

Some of the sections follow the ERA notes closely, other have tutorials only.

Contents:

1. Fourier Transforms
